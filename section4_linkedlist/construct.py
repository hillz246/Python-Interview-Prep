## Constructor for LinkedList
# Create first node when we initialize (4)

# LL: Constructor
# You are tasked with implementing a basic data structure: a singly linked list.

# To accomplish this, you will create two classes, Node and LinkedList.

# The Node class will represent an individual node within the linked list, while the LinkedList class will manage the overall list structure.

# Your implementation should satisfy the following requirements:



# Create a Node class with the following features:

# A constructor that takes a value as an argument and initializes the value attribute of the node.

# A next attribute, initialized to None, which will store a reference to the next node in the list.

# Create a LinkedList class with the following features:

# A constructor that takes a value as an argument, creates a new Node with that value, and initializes the head and tail attributes of the linked list to point to the new node.

# A length attribute, initialized to 1, which represents the current number of nodes in the list.

class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.next = None


class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self, value):
        new_node = Node(value)
        self.head = new_node
        self.tail = new_node
        self.length = 1


my_linked_list = LinkedList(4)

print(my_linked_list.head.value)
